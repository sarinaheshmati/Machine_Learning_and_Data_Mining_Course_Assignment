# Rainfall Prediction with Climate Data Analysis

## Objective
Develop a machine learning model to predict the rainfall for the next day based on daily weather data collected over the past 10 years.

## Dataset
[Climate Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package)

## Challenges
- **Missing Data:** Handling incomplete or missing data.
- **Feature Diversity:** Converting categorical data to numerical using techniques like Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding.
- **Feature Correlation:** Identifying and managing correlated features to improve model performance.
- **Outliers and Noise:** Detecting and removing outliers and noise.
- **Class Imbalance:** Addressing class imbalance with appropriate techniques and evaluating the impact.

## Steps
1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Encode categorical features if necessary.
   - Normalize and standardize data.
   - Handle null values.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Identify important features.
   - Analyze feature correlations and distributions with visualizations.

3. **Modeling:**
   - Implement and compare **KNN**, **SVM**, and **Decision Tree** models.
   - Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - Assess model performance using a test set.
   - Report metrics: Recall, Precision, Accuracy, and F1 Score.
   - Provide explanations for hyperparameter choices.
